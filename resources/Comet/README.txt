release 2020.01 rev. 4 (2020.01.4), release date 2021/05/11
- Bug fix: for Percolator .pin output, correctly calculate dM (mass difference) for
  all lower hit entries. The top hit's dM value was being reported for all lower
  hits for each spectrum query. Issue and fix reported by D. Goldfarb.
- Bug fix: address potential ThreadPool sleep issue. Issue identified and fixed
  by D. Shteynberg.

release 2020.01 rev. 3 (2020.01.3), release date 2021/03/18
- Revert use of maps (ala HiXcorr) to spectral arrays for spectral preprocessing.
  The use of maps had a measurable performance hit that was especially noticeable
  for real-time search applications.
- For each variable_mod0X parameter, extend the 4th field to allow specifying
  a minimum (in addition to the maximum) number of modified residues in each
  peptide. Feature request by J. Mohr.
- In the text output, the xcorr rank column (2nd column) will now handle ties in
  its rank reporting.
- Extend maximum length of reported protein accession string from 99 to 511
  characters. Feature request by L. Liu.
- Real-time search: Comet was inadvertantly looping over all PSMs for a
  spectrum query to retrieve matched protein names. This was unnecessary and
  caused a performance hit; protein names are now retrieve only for the top
  scoring peptide(s).
- Bug fix: added a check to see if a directory path was specified as the sequence
  database. Under linux, if a directory were specified as the database, Comet
  would simply sit there and not report any error.  Thanks to L. Mendoza for
  reporting this issue.
- Bug fix: report proper flanking residues for a peptide when it is identified in
  multiple proteins; use the flanking residues from the first protein in the
  database.  Similarly, flanking residues for start methionine clipped sequences
  were addressed as those were not being handled correctly either.
- Bug fix: for real-time search using Comet's internal decoy peptides, storing
  and reporting of duplicate peptides, e.g. a peptide that is present in both
  target and decoy forms, was not being handled correctly; this has been
  addressed.
- Bug fix: in the pep.xml output, the "index" attribute of the "spectrum_query"
  element was not being populated correctly. With each spectrum batch, the index
  value was being reset to 1. This has been corrected.

release 2020.01 rev. 2 (2020.01.2), release date 2021/01/05
- Bug fix: Fixed issue where spectra were not being searched. This was due to
  the poor attempt at a fix in release 2020.01.1 for spectra with all zero
  intensity peaks.

release 2020.01 rev. 1 (2020.01.1), release date 2020/12/17
- For TIMS-TOF mzML files, changed the scan number reporting to be the scan
  "index" value plus "1".
- Bug fix: Fixed issue where spectra that have all peak intensities of zero
  would cause the program to crash.  Issue reported by D. Shteynberg.
- Bug fix: Fixed issue where mzML scans without a precursor charge were not being
  searched. This issue was limited to mzML and not a problem with mzXML files.
  Issue reported by D. Shteynberg.

release 2020.01 rev. 0 (2020.01.0), release date 2020/11/09
- Implemented mzIdentML output via the parameter entry "output_mzidentmlfile".
  The mzIdentML format does not fully support the reporting of Comet results so
  this is considered preliminary support. Issues with the mzIdentML format for
  Comet: (a) It appears as if the mzIdentML format expects decoy entries to exist
  in the input FASTA file; at least that seems to be the expectation in the
  documentation that I've read. Comet's mzIdentML output will report decoy protein
  references even though they do not exist in the underlying FASTA file. The
  reported decoy protein, like in the other output formats, is generated by
  appending the decoy prefix to the protein accession that the decoy peptide was
  generated from. I have no idea if the mzIdentML format allows for this or not.
  (b) Within the "FragmentTolerance" element, the requirement of fragment "search
  tolerance plus value" (MS:1001412) and "search tolerance minus value"
  (MS:1001413) make no sense in the context of spectral correlation matching used
  in Comet, SEQUEST and other tools that perform the cross-correlation score. A
  fragment bin value and bin offset are needed to encapsulate the corresponding
  fragment settings in Comet. Currently 1/2 of the "fragment_bin_offset" value is
  reported for the search tolerance plus/minus values but this is a sad hack that
  should not be required.
- The preliminary score has been modified in a few ways. First, I extended the
  number of preliminary score ion "bins" considered from 200 to 1000. This
  allows matching many more fragment ions in the preliminary score algorithm to
  get a more representative matched ion count reported in the output files. Before
  this change, the matched fragment numbers are likely under-reported for many
  spectral matches of longer peptides. I have also gotten rid of the peak picking,
  smoothing, and "stair-stepping" that used to be applied to the preliminary score
  spectrum. All of these things contribute to a change in the calculated
  preliminary scores. This score is still reported because some post-processing
  tools make use of it but if it were up to me, I would get rid of it entirely.
- Added the parameter entry "use_Z1_ions" to consider "Z• + 1" ions (typically
  for ETD/ECD searches). Feature requested by A. Grimaud.
- Add support for Comet's internal decoy peptides in the indexed database search
  (intended for real-time search application). As decoy peptides don't need to
  be explicitly present in the indexed database, this reduces the index database
  size and indexing time by nearly half compared to indexing a FASTA file composed
  of target+decoy sequences.
- Add support for reporting all matched proteins in an indexed database search.
  Previously only one protein name was returned for each peptide identification.
- Corrected/changed residue 'O' from Ornithine to Pyrrolysine. This entails
  retiring the "add_O_ornithine" parameter entry and adding "add_O_pyrrolysine".
  Thanks to P. Charles for reporting the correction.
- Added support for changing the text file output file extension from its
  default "txt" extension to a custom file extension via a new parameter entry
  "text_file_extension". Text file outputs are generated when the "output_txtfile"
  parameter is set to "1". This custom/hidden parameter will need to be manually
  added to your params file for use (i.e. it is not present in the example params
  file available for download nor is it written in the comet.params.new file
  generated by the command "comet -p"). Feature requested by PatternLab for
  Proteomics.
- Added a parameter entry "explicit_deltacn" which controls how the deltaCn
  output score is calculated. By default, Comet will very crudely analyze
  sequence similarity when calculating the deltaCn score. This results in the
  deltaCn being calculated between the top hit and the first dissimilar peptide in
  order to avoid very small deltaCn values when the top N peptides are all the
  same (such as different modified forms of the same peptide). When
  "explicit_deltacn". is set to "1", the sequence similarity analysis is not used
  and the deltaCn is calculated as the difference between the top scoring peptide
  and the second best scoring peptide. This custom parameter will need to be
  manually added to your params file for use. Feature requested by PatternLab for
  Proteomics.
- Added "sp_rank" and "retention_time_sec" columns to the text output. Feature
  requested by PatternLab for Proteomics.
- Added preliminary support for searching TIMS-TOF mzML files. MSToolkit updates
  now allow TIMS-TOF mzML files to be searched. Previous parsing of the mzML
  file would return no spectra to search. I should note that I'm not sure what the
  returned scan numbers represent. Also, a function to return the file's last scan
  number was not updated for these TIMS-TOF files; this causes Comet's search
  progress percentage reporting to return nonsensical values. Thanks to D.
  Shteynberg and M. Hoopmann for the MSToolkit mods to support this.
- Extend the "activation_method" parameter to accept "SID" as a filter string
  for searching Thermo mzML/mzXML files with the string " sid=" in the filter
  line text. Feature requested by J. Mohr.
- Removed reporting of "deltacnstar" in the pepXML output. It appears that the
  score has been reported as "0.0" for every result and I've never understood
  what it represented so I'm taking this opportunity to get rid of it now.
- Changed the "No_enzyme" text to "Cut_everywhere" in the enzyme definition of
  the exported comet.params file. Hopefully this clarifies the purpose of that
  enzyme definition of cleaving everywhere (as opposed to no digestion which
  "No_enzyme" could convey). The enzyme text strings in the params file have no
  function in Comet and can be named anything.
- In the spectral processing, large spectral arrays were replaced by peak
  vectors as in the HiXcorr implementation of Comet. This makes the spectral
  processing a bit more efficient, especially for small fragment_bin_tol settings.
- Bug fix: When a protein N-terminal static modification is specified, it was
  not being applied in the preliminary score routine for N-terminal peptides
  resulting from a clipped methionine. Thanks to Thermo's BioPharma Finder group
  for reporting the bug.
- Bug fix: In the text file output, the position of static C-terminal
  modifications in the "modifications" column was always incorrectly reported as
  "1" in the encoded modfication string; this has been corrected. Thanks to
  Thermo's BioPharma Finder group for reporting the bug.
- Bug fix: When running multiple searches via interfacing with CometWrapper.dll
  under Windows, the output file of subsequent searches was not updating. Thus
  searches were simply overwriting the first output file. This has been addressed
  with a simple variable initialization. Thanks to Thermo's BioPharma Finder group
  for reporting the bug.
- Bug fix: Corrected a bug where every matched/duplicate protein was not always
  reported due to a rounding/precision issue with storing of the xcorr. This was
  noticed for an edge case (bad spectrum, small database) that should not affect
  users in practice.
- I've sadly had to push off Comet-PTM integration to the next release again.


Comet is an open source MS/MS database search engine released under the Apache
2.0 license.

Current supported input formats are mzXML, mzML, mgf, ms2, cms2, and Thermo RAW
files (under Windows).  Current supported output formats are pepXML, Percolator
pin (tsv), SQT, tab-delimited text, and mzIdentML.

To run a search on an input file requires the Comet binary, a search parameters
file (comet.params), an input file, and a protein sequence database in FASTA
format.  The syntax of a search assuming the binary is named "comet.exe":

   comet.exe input.mzXML comet.exe input.ms2

Search parameters, such as which sequence database to query, modifications to
consider, mass tolerances, output format, etc. are defined in the comet.params
file.

One can generate a parameters file with the command

   comet.exe -p

Rename the created file "comet.params.new" to "comet.params".

Windows and linux command line binaries are included with this release.


To compile under linux, just type "make"; this should work on the vast majority
of systems. The resulting binary is "comet.exe" in the root directory.

To compile with Windows Visual Studio 2017, load the Comet.sln file, set the
target as "Release" and "x64" (or "Win32"), and build "Comet".  Building the
entire solution may work but I've seen build issues with CometUI which is not
necessary.  For Windows, an additional dependency is Thermo's MSFileReader
library to read RAW files directly.  MSFileReader can be downloaded under "Other
Software Releases" at https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login Or
simply skip MSFileReader and the ability to read RAW files directly by addding
"# define _NO_THERMO_RAW" at the head of these files
