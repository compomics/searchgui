            <b>SearchGUI</b> supports two types of modifications, fixed and variable. Fixed modifications will 
            be added to every residue that can be modified by the given modification, while the variable modifications 
            are sometimes added and sometimes not. Which type to choose depends on your experimental setup.
            <br><br>
            You can add multiple modifications of each type, but remember that the more variable modifications you 
            add the more complex the search becomes which increases the risk of false positives.
            <br><br>
            Initially only the most used modifications are shown. To show all modifications simply select 'All 
            Modifications' in the drop down menu above the lits of modifications.
            <br><br>
            To see the modification details or to add or edit user defined modifications, click the options icon 
            in the upper right corner of the modification panel. Holding the mouse over a given modification 
            will also give you the basic details.
